# Performance-Analysis-of-LTE-Handover-Algorithms-in-NS-3
Evaluation of LTE handover algorithms (A3-RSRP, A2-A4-RSRQ) in NS-3 with 8-cell network simulation. Analyzes mobility impact on throughput, SINR, and handover performance across varying speeds (10-100 m/s) with automated data collection and visualization.
